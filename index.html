      <h2>What Is a Travel-Rewards Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>A travel-rewards card gives you bonus value when you spend — typically in the form of points or miles that you can redeem for flights, hotel stays, upgrades, car rentals or travel-related services. Some cards also offer perks like lounge access, travel insurance or hotel/airline status.</p>
      <p>These cards are targeted at people who travel regularly — but you can use everyday purchases (groceries, bills, commute, etc.) to build travel currency, if the card’s earn categories align with your spending habits.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How You Earn and Redeem Travel Rewards</h2>
      <p>Every purchase posts to your card account and accrues points or miles depending on its category (e.g. travel, dining, general). Bonus categories often deliver higher earn rates, but you should check if there’s a spending cap or time limit attached.</p>
      <p>When you redeem, you can transfer points to airline or hotel partners, use a travel portal run by the issuer, or book directly with accompanying benefits like free baggage, travel credits or elite-tier perks. The value you get per point depends heavily on how and when you redeem.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Typical Travel Perks and Benefits</h2>
      <p>Common extras include airport lounge access, free checked bags, concierge services, travel insurance (trip cancellation, delay, rental car), priority boarding or hotel upgrades. Some cards also waive foreign transaction fees — valuable for frequent travelers or those spending internationally.</p>
      <p>Other perks may involve statement credits for travel-related expenses (airfare, hotels, rideshares), companion tickets or accelerated point earning on travel and dining categories.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>How to Maximize Value: Timing, Redemption & Strategy</p>
      <p>To get the most from travel cards, it helps to align redemptions with high-value uses — e.g. premium flights, business-class upgrades, or high-season travel. Redeeming for low-value items (like small purchases or gift cards) rarely justifies holding such cards long-term.</p>
      <p>Tracking award charts, transfer bonuses, blackout dates and partner availability is key. Smart users often accumulate points across multiple cards, then transfer when there's a favorable redemption window to unlock outsized value.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Costs, Fees, and What Can Erase the Benefit</h2>
      <p>Annual fees, foreign transaction fees, and potential currency surcharges can reduce or nullify the advantage of travel-rewards cards. If you don't travel often, the cost may outweigh benefits.</p>
      <p>Cancellations, schedule changes, blackout dates or devaluations of award charts can also erode value. Many perks require you to meet spending thresholds or pay for flights/hotels with the card — plan accordingly to avoid surprises.</p>
